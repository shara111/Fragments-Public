# Continuous Delivery Workflow
#
# This should happen whenever we push a new tag, and we tag an existing
# commit after we know it's good (e.g., has been tested).
#
# To create a new tag, we also need to update the package.json version:
#
# $ npm version 0.5.0
#
# This will update `version` in package.json to `0.5.0` and create a new
# tag, `v0.5.0` in git. We'll then use this tag (i.e., `v0.5.0`) to tag
# our docker image before we push to AWS.
